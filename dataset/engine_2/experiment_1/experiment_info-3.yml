    description: "Time-series current data collected under varying load conditions. Data is organized by load level and motor phase."
  - type: "vibration"
    description: "Time-series vibration data collected under varying load conditions. CSV files are stored directly within load condition folders."
load_conditions:
  - label: "1st_load"
    values: [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
  - label: "2nd_load"

defect: "Bearing defect"
notes: "Motor speed is constant; load variations are introduced via generator parameter adjustments. Data for current and vibration were acquired sequentially using the same equipment."
